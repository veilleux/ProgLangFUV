# ProgLangFUV
ProgLang course at FUV
PLP (Programming Language Project):
  - Each student will pick a language that she is interested in learning and using
    for the rest of the semester
  - I strongly recommend:
     - not picking a language that doesn't have good online resources or tutorials, or at least a
       few books that you can buy or get from a library
         - ideally, it will also be a language that can run on multiple platforms, but we can talk about that
         - Though do be careful: not all online resources are going to give you the right answers.
     - Don't pick any of the esoteric languages like Brainf*ck or LOLCODE
     - You can't use Python or Java; those are languages you've learned elsewhere
     - Each student has to be working on a different language from every other student.  It's fine
       for people to work on variations (C, C++, C#), but not the exact same language
     - If you don't know Java (e.g. a few of you might be taking Data Structures now) you can choose Java but 	you will have to do more work for the final project and probably for the homework assignments as well
     - I will *not* be an expert in most of the languages that you choose.  That's why it's important that you
       make sure that you have access to good documentation.  Also, be prepared to sweat a little bit (or a lot)
       in this class.  If you get stuck, there might not be much I can do for you.
